Q: Why did you choose the particular mark(s)?
A: I choose circle as my mark because it is an easy one for a simple task like this one. And it can use size and color for more channel options if needed.  

Q: Why did you choose the particular channels?
A: I choose position as my channels since the relationship between wing length and bird size can be easily seen by examine the circle position. Linear scaling was used since I find the relationship seems to be linear. I might use log scaling or others if I find the relationship is not linear.

Q: Why is your design good in helping to answer the question?
A: Because both data are quantitive, using a scatter plot is good when the relationship is unknown so one can see the circle patterns and hence be able to answer the relationship question. 

Q: What are the limitations of your design in attempting to answer the question?
A: If the relationship is not linear, I will have to change the scaling and the choice is very designer-dependent.
